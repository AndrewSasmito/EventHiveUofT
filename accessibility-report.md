# Accessibility Report

### Principles of Universal Design and how our program adheres to it:

#### 1. Equitable Use

This program ensures that it avoids stigmatizing or segregating any users depending on their abilities, and maintains security, privacy, and safety
for all users independent of any other factors. In the future, to provide the same means of use for any user of the program, we plan on 
implementing a screen reader to read out text to those who cannot see properly, different event marker colour coding depending on whether
a user is colour-blind or not, and larger font sizes for those who have trouble reading small text.

#### 2. Flexibility in Use

In order for our program to be more flexible in use, we plan on implementing a feature to set the mouse and zoom sensitivity while scrolling
through the map, as it is currently fixed no matter who is using the program. We may also choose to include options to alter the size of
map markers and font so it is easier for the user to interact with our program.

#### 3. Simple and Intuitive Use
This program is simple and intuitive. There is a log in and registration prompt that has buttons with clear and instructive labels,
a side bar with buttons that displays various features that can be used, a map that allows scrolling, zooming in and out, and supports
interacting with events, a search feature that has tags that can be selected or deselected, and pages displaying an event and its information.
There is no unnecessary complexity, and there are error messages to guide the user if they need it.

#### 4. Perceptible Information

This program includes a visual display of where events are located using a map, a way to search for events using filters, and a way to create or
modify events by interacting with different pages and buttons. To further convey information, our group can include short descriptions above
buttons or markers that explain what that feature does or how the user can interact with it.

#### 5. Tolerance for Error

Whenever the user makes an error, an error message is displayed and tells them what they should do instead, for example trying to log in
with a username that doesn't exist. This way we incorporate fail safe features, and our program is arranged in a way such that an error doesn't
break or stop the program as the user can easily exit out of the error message and reattempt what they have been trying to do correctly. 
Another example can be a user zooming in too far in the map for their liking, they can always zoom out without any problems.

#### 6. Low Physical Effort

This program only requires you to use your hands and fingers to use a mouse to click on buttons, drag the map, and a keyboard to type in details you 
may need. Thus, our project allows the user to maintain a neutral body position and minimize any sustained physical effort, adhering to the low
physical effort principle.

#### 7. Size and Space for Approach and Use

Because this design principle focuses mostly on the user being able to physically reach any components they will use to interact with our 
program, their posture, and the amount of space they have while using it, it is inapplicable to our project because our project is purely 
software based and will not have any physical components for the user to reach/touch/need space to access.

### Who this program is marketed to:

This program is marketed towards students and faculty members of the University of Toronto who want to create, modify, or RSVP to events that are happening on campus. Of course, the user base could be more than only UofT students and staff and include those who just want to attend UofT events. The reason that this is marketed towards students and faculty members of UofT is because the focus of the application is to serve as an event hub for the University, with a large
focus on the school's campus, which is achieved by introducing an interactive map centered at the University of Toronto's campus. Because school and work can be very fast paced, this program can help students keep track of what events are happening,
can let them RSVP whenever they need, can allow organizers to notify all attendees by email, and can give them an idea of where
the events take place right away.

## Are there certain demographics that are less likely to use this program? 

There are certain demographics that are less likely to use this program, including those with disabilities such as blindness or those with personal/social limitations such as not being able to access public spaces. This is because our project does not have screen readers to help those who have trouble seeing, and the main purpose of our program is to help users participate in events across campus, which is something somebody with personal or social limitations might not find appealing.
